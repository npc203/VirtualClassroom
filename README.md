### Idea description
Due to the on going pandemic, education and work hasmigrated to online. People especially children donâ€™t feel thecurrent remote learning tools to be interactive and effective. Amore gamified platform can make remote education fun andinteresting. Thus, we decided to create a virtual classroomwhere students and teachers can walk, sit on their desiredchairs, write on the white board, conduct quizzes and literallydo all possible things that can happen inside a typicalclassroom. The idea revolves around gamification of onlineeducation to make it interactive and fun!
